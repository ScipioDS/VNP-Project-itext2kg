A key aspect of governance is establishing a framework within which the lines of authority are clear, the responsibility and accountability of each position defined, and the levels of decision-making structured to enable effective and efficient delivery of the program and its components. The governance principle of program management can be distilled into four key characteristics: transparency, oversight, compliance, and resiliency.

The risk appetite assessment is a critical component of program delivery, as it determines the level of effort required to monitor and assess risks during program execution. The output of this activity is the program initial risk assessment, which serves as an input to various planning stages, including business case, cost estimate, charter, roadmap, and risk management planning. An assessment of program scope defines the work required to deliver a benefit (major product, service, or result with specified features and functions), along with major management activities at the program level. Program scope management comprises the activities that define, develop, oversee, and verify program scope. Scope management aligns the program scope with the program's goals and objectives. The program change management plan is a component of the program management plan that establishes program change management principles and procedures, including the approach for capturing requested changes, evaluating each requested change, determining the disposition of each requested change, communicating a decision to impacted stakeholders, documenting the change request and supporting details, and authorizing funding and work. It is important to mention that the plan should focus on how to evaluate the impact of a change (e.g., change in an organization, including program sponsor and program steering committee; change in a cost; change in a component; change in the program management plan; change in a technology; etc.) on the program outcomes and, therefore, on the benefits expected by the stakeholders. Based on that assumption, the program steering committee should agree on the level of program change thresholds that should trigger the change process. Program communications management includes activities for the timely and appropriate generation, collection, distribution, storage, retrieval, and ultimate disposition of program information. These activities provide the critical links between people and information that are necessary for communications and decision-making.\",\n",
