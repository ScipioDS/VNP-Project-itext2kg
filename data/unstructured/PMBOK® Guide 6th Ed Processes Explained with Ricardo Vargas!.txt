today I like to talk to you about the PM
box 6th edition if you recall four years
ago I did something very very similar to
that for the PM box fifth edition so
what I would do today it's I will start
from the first process that you should
do in your project up to the end and why
I'm doing this one of the key reasons
I'm doing this it's because if you look
the PMO guide very thick six seven
hundred pages the first reaction is wow
it's it's a lot to learn it's it's a
very strong body inside and it's it's
not very easy to understand the peermark
guide it's mostly a reference guide so
what I would do here it's to read the
PMBOK guide but in a different way and
this is basically on part two of the
guide because on the sixth edition of
p.m. Bach we have 12 13 chapters on the
first part the three first chapters are
the general concepts what is a project
what's project management second chapter
is more about organizational structure
how the structures change depending on
how much leverage do you give to the
projects the third chapter it's a new
one talks about the project manager and mostly on the PMI talent triangle and
discuss more about the competences of
the project manager between chapter four
up to chapter 13 we're talking about ten
knowledge areas and then on part two is
the standard the ansi standard of
project management and this used to be
chapter three on the previous version and this is the core this second part of
what i'm talking now because most of the
time when you read for example scope you
read all process of scope but it's not
the way you do projects
because you do projects in a different way you do in a much more interconnected
way and this is what I want you to teach
you today how to do that the first thing
you need to have is this piece of paper
so this you can download on the link
below so you can download this and you
can download the processes then you put
some blue or a tape here to use it as a
reference so I will do this today to
show you how a project is built so look
here we have in a light grey just to
help me to show you an out so to guide
you through the process so the first
thing we need to understand that it's every single project start on what we
call initiating process so initiating
process basically when you start a
project it doesn't matter which kind of
project you you're talking you start by
developing the project charter project
charter the best way to explain to you
is birth certificate why I'm saying this
because it's it's something that
recognized that a project exists so here
you give an own a name a project manager
some basic conditions it's a one or two
page document just to underline what is
the intention and why this project exists in parallel to that you do a
stakeholder process that is to identify
stakeholders so let me explain this what
is in stakeholder stakeholder is any
person or entity that has any kind of
interest in your project may be positive
maybe negative so a supplier a client another
area in your organization's they are all
stakeholders and look one important
point if you see here 4.1 minutes we are
talking about the chapter four of p.m.
balk first process chapter four is
integration okay and this is thirteen
point one 13 is stakeholder management
so we do this almost together one very
important point is that a lot of people
do not understand this arrow that goes
both ways why this because you don't do
this first and then you do this you do
this almost together and this arrow
allows you to go back because when you
identify some stake or maybe you need to revisit your project chartres and vice
versa so to do that it's what you built
the initiation in one very important
point if you read the p.m. back from page 1 to
the to the end you read for and then you
read 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 and denry 13 so
I'm telling you read 4.1 then go to
thirteen point one and take a look
because this is how things happen in reality so when you have the initiation
you have your profit charting this very
light slim document that just address
what your project will do and then a
list of who are my stakeholders this is
what is the initiation of a project
after initiation the initiation we need
to do the planning and this is exactly
to try to understand how we are planning
to do our project so we will basically
understand theses pieces that we need to
have in place to make sure that this
idea here will satisfy the interest of
these stakeholders and will deliver what
you want remember we we do not live and
create projects to respect the flow the
flow must reflect the reality of the
work we do and basically to do that we
started here by integration what do we
need to do here we need to start the
planning by integration and the
integration is the second process of
integration that is called develop the
project management plan so let me explain to you integration integration
only exists to be the glue that connect
the order nine areas that's it
integration exists to avoid that scope
overrule risk risk overrule cost so the
integration is to make sure that
everything is balanced producing the
benefit of the project and the results
you want here so to develop the project
plan then you need to do a lot of things
and work in different areas the first
one that you need to start working is
the area of scope and you need to plan
how you will manage the scope of your
project look you will see many times
here plan scope management plan schedule
management and every time you see the
word plan and management we are talking
about the rule of the game so what is
plan scope management
you need to define here how do you plan
to manage the scope of your project let's suppose that someone wants to add
work to your project will you accept it
not accept it it must be approve it what
is the level of approval so this is the
route I love to use an analogy imagine a
football game a soccer game you have
some rules for example there are 11
players the goal is only when the ball
crossed the line fully so you have some
rules why because you cannot define the rules
when you are is acute in the project
writing need to agree on the rules and
this are the rules and this may be a set
of bullets maybe a small document or
maybe something that your project office will create but it's something that
delineate the rules of how you plan to
manage the scope and then the second
thing you need to do is to collect the
requirements so now I need to understand
what's the work I need to do and then I
need to collect the requirements first
what is the requirement requirement are things that I need to do to deliver what
I want
for example the requirements can be
functional requirements for example I want and for example an electric door in
my car this is a functional requirement
what is a technical requirement its what
is the size and the characteristics of
this engine to support that door opening
automatically and then you have the
scope and the requirements of activities
by the the engine install the engine
test the engine so this is where you
collect and most of the time you collect these requirements by talking to some of
the stakeholders and trying to
understand how you will build the way
between where you are and where you want to be after collecting these
requirements you must shape the scope of
your project
basically you need to combine these requirements functional technical and
activities and in parts of the work and
you define the scope basically you
produce one one document I don't like
the word document because it seems like
bureaucracy but you produce something that reflects the scope of your project
and we call this scope statement so the
scope statement will define okay how do
you want to approach your project in after that you will create the work
breakdown structure or WBS remember the
WPS is that it looks like an old chart
where you split your project and you
break your project into smaller much
more manageable pieces of work I love
this and I think that the WBS is the
tool to manage the scope so this for
process or things you need to do to
deliver your work and this will be a
piece of your project plan after you
know what you want to do you need to
understand how much time do you plan
then you do a planned schedule
management and this you will work on the
schedule remember why spend some time
explaining the scope because here is
absolutely the same of plan scope
management but here I'm concerned about
schedule for example what I would do if
some tests become late how I'm planning
to calculate durations will I do
analogy which kind of tool and planning
to use how how precise do I need to be
when I set an activity duration so these
are basically the rules of the game when
the game is talking about schedule in
one point that you may notice for those who are from coming from the p.m. balk
fifth edition it usually could be called
time and now it's called schedule
because we are talking about this time and how the times flow
in your project after that you will
define the activities very very
important here here you create a WBS
here you are defining activities you
need to accomplish to deliver that word
package on your WBS so let me give you
an example WPS package door tasks cut the door
frame the door put the lock so this are
the activities that will deliver that
scope and why activities are here
because the activities are the root of
you create your sequence and the
duration so you need to have this
capillarity you need to understand which
kind of activities to then understand ok
how much time and what do I need to do
first and look one thing are you looking
that I'm making a lot of arrows why I am
spending my time doing this all this
sets of arrows it's because I want to
make clear and that the biggest is
mistake and even when people talk and
use the concept of waterfall you know
when you use the waterfall when the
water goes down the water does not come
back so this technically cannot be seen
as waterful because I'm talking that we
go back all this time to revisit because maybe you were put in a duration here
and you see oh god I forgot another
activity and then you need to come back
in most of the time you may come back
here and this is a fluid process it's a
fluid it's not rigid if it's rigid it's
wrong
pay attention on that if it's ready it's wrong so this is just a mental model to
help you to understand how you should
and after doing all of this what you
will do you will develop your scandal
and many people ask me okay what is a
scandal is it a Gantt chart is it a
network diagram yes yes and much more
schedule is any kind of display of how
your project will be place it over time
the most common of course because of the
tools are the Gantt chart the network
diagram but you need to develop your
schedule so this schedule here will give
you an idea of how much time do you need to perform everything to perform and to
deliver this code so this is the second
group did you see that I'm bringing this
I'm bringing this again to the project
plan after that scope scale I have the
cost side because now I have the
activities I know the scope now I can
start thinking about the cost of my
project and the first thing I do and I
will repeat this many times I need to
plan the cost management
did you see how things start to repeat plan cost plan schedule and plan scope
so here rules of the scope here rules of
the schedule here rules of the cost for
example who has the approval to spend
money if I'm over for example the cost
of one one material or one resource is
over budget
who has the autonomy to approve that what do I do
so these are the rules of the game when
the game is talking about cost then
after that I will estimate costs if I
know the activities and I have a clear
idea of my scope I can estimate cost and
then after estimating cost knowing the
I have my schedule I can do what I can
develop my budget I can understand my
s-curve I can understand how do I plan
to spend the money and these three tasks
are part the planning process related to
scope after that I need to plan the
quality management again one more time
remember when the word plan and management comes together we only change
here what the knowledge area so what do
I want here you may answer with me I
want here to know which are the quality
astonished I need to comply with the
project what is quality for me on this
context what do I expect to be delivered
in terms of quality and this will also
be together with my project plan after
that I need to start remember look eight
seven six these are the chapters so it's
very common for those who are not used
to the PM book it's very common that we
say o chapter 6 when we say chapter 6 we
are talking about schedule so this is
why we start with 4 and why not with three or two or one because chapter one
two and three there are definitions and
this is why we start with number four so
now I need to introduce to you to a new
knowledge area but an old new knowledge
area it used to be called human
resources but now it's just resources
why because now I am incorporating on
this area materials equipment and human
resources so now this knowledge area is
called resource and the first one is
plan resource management so every single
one its plan management rules of the
game of how do I plan to manage my
resources
in a very simple way so how do I plan to recruit am i able to recruit people or
do I need to use internal resources am I
able to buy things or do I need to use
the procurement area so this are all here these are the rules remember most
of the time if you have any area that
supports your project like a project
management office or PMO most of this is
already done you have some rules and
policies in place that regulate what you
can do as a project management in what
you can't after that you need to
estimate activity resources oops let's
understand this let's understand this
because here we have something new in
the past activity resource or estimate
resources used to be on the time now
with this new resource area it was
moving to resource but I want you to pay
attention on this this item 9.2 okay and
this item six four six point four they
are brothers they are twins better they
were they they cannot live without the
other why because I need to do to know which
resource I have 2x to make how much time
I will take let me give you a very super
simple example let's take this wall and
let's take I say a one worker can build
this wall in 10 days it's reasonable to
say that two workers can be it in five
days so this is exactly what I'm talking
here because most of the tasks, most I'm
not saying all are effort driven. When
I say effort driven I'm saying if you add
more resources you reduce the time up to
a certain level so this is why it used
to be together now it's in two different
areas does it mean that you
need to do it separately no never think
about that
so this to process are the process related to resources remember one thing
costs are intimately linked to resources
and time so did you see that how things
were together so if you were reading the
PM book you should try to follow
something like that you should not read
9.3 after 9.2 I suggest you to read 10.1
in Y 10.1 because this is what you
should do in the planning phase then you
do communications management look as I
said here rules of scope schedule cost
quality resource here is communication
here it's just it's like different this
plan communication management one of the
key things here it's you will build your communication plan so basically you know
what do you want to communicate who do
you want to communicate to what where do
you want to communicate when do you want
to communicate how much it will cost
this communication how do you want to
communicate so this basic information so
if you have a meeting if you are planning an exception meeting if you
have for example meetings only if
something goes wrong outside the
boundaries so you can put this here because this will regulate your
communication so it's a very very
important I will talk about this a
little bit later when when I'm talking about stakeholders here so after doing
that then it comes to another very big
knowledge area almost as big as as a
scope and schedule it's risk management
why because risk is a intrinsic part of
your project so the first thing you need
to do is to plan how you want to
approach risk management and
let me explain here basically the answer
you want to give you the only answer
that is super relevant is what is your
tolerance why let's suppose I invite you
to do a bank jump maybe for me it's
extremely risky maybe for you it's not
so tolerance
it's exactly what define what is risk for your group in your organization and
what is not risk for your group in your
organization because if you don't know
what is your tolerance maybe everything
can be a risk or nothing can be a risk
after knowing that you or your risk
tolerance then you come here and you
start to identify your risks so together
with your stakeholders your group you
start to identify okay which kind of risk do I have in this project which
kind of traps and opportunities do I
need to manage after let's suppose you
identify here let me guess 300 things
that may happen in your project positive
and negative what do you need to do after that you cannot say oh I will
answer to everything it most of the time
it's just impossible so what do you do
you do two things you do a qualitative
risk analysis and quantitative risk
analysis so you do both what is the
difference between this two items
qualitative I use a scale low medium
high green color yellow color red color
so I use some kind of standard some kind
of scale and what is a quantitative risk
analysis when I use math to calculate
probability and impact for example let's
suppose I have a dice of six faces and I
want to know what's the chance to get
one in the dice it's 1/6
so this is calculated this is
quantitative many times quantitative is
great but many times quantitative is
much harder to get so this is exactly to
understand each of the risks identified
are they big are they very big risks or
irrelevant risks and this will help me
to do what this will help me to plan
potential responses to death risks so
what I need to do here I need to plan I
need to identify okay what can I do to
protect my project from that risk then
maybe I will say I'll buy an insurance
or maybe I will say I will change some
parts of my scope maybe I will put more
financial reserves so it depends so then
you plan this and this five processes
they work together again look the arrows
they go forward and backward why because
maybe you are doing the quantitative
analysis and suddenly you identify
another risk and you cannot say all the
risk is done I cannot go back this is
not good if you do that it will be wrong
completely wrong then you go back here
maybe you don't go only back here you
look go to the plan to understand the
integrated impact of your response to
understand okay do I need to put more
money so remember this is all fluid this
look all the process only exists to
support you to understand what you need
to do that's it so now on the
procurement plan so you need to
understand basically what you need to do
and what you need to do in terms of what
what do I need to buy what do I need to
make so the make or buy decision is
right here so
what I would do with with my procurement will like do everything internally or
not unless but definitely not least is
the try and a stakeholder engagement and
what is this remember identify the stakeholders here
so now I need to understand it too that
my stakeholders for example influence
and power and I need to group them and
understand what I will do here and now I
want to give you another advice remember
the twins I said here between duration
and resources I want to introduce you to
another set of twins plan communication
remember I introduced and plan
stakeholder engagement why I'm telling
these two are also twins because most of
the communication will be exactly to
reinforce stakeholder engagement so I
need to do this together for example
let's suppose that you have a
stakeholder here that you need some kind
of special communication then you come
here and you create this communication
so this is why they're twins and they work together so this was the planning
process and at the end everything is
consolidated in this project management
plan okay so this will give you an idea
on how do you plan to do this project
this I'm working about what what and
here how so this is my approach to this
project and then later we'll talk about
how do we execute and monitor and
control our project
after having our plan ready we will
start this accusin and the monitoring
and controlling process so I want now of
course I will explain first basic ution
but I want now to highlight both
execution and monitoring and why I
wanted to highlight this to process at
the same time because they work together
you don't execute everything to check if
everything is fine so it's a process
that is a very fluid process here so you
execute a new check everything is fine
then then you may replant look this
arrow you made really cute so it's a
very very fluid process and of course
the center of the planning was
integration the center of the initiation
was integration the center of this
equation is exactly one more time
integration so the third integration
process the second was the plan the turn
direct and managed project work what is
important here it's not saying is acute
in the project why because all this flow
is how you will manage the project and
now you you as a project manager or a
team member you usually are not the
resource is acute in the work most of
the time so what do you need to do you
direct and you manage the work that is being done by what by the resources you
are defining for the activities so this
is exactly the idea and now there is one
new thing on the p.m. Bach
extradition it's a new integration
process called manage project knowledge
in a very very simple way you can
understand this as lessons learn it so
what do you you need to register what
you're learning from the project work
what is working what is not working what
is doing well not well and you
registered this because this knowledge
is very it's it's very valuable so you
need to have this lessons learning so
this to process are the two central processes of this equation but this to
process are supported by all this order
process let's see them the first one is
manage quality remember one thing here
plan quality here you are setting how
your quality will be here you're
managing the results that I'm getting
from here are reasonable in terms of
quality now related to resources you
will acquire the resources here is where
you will hire new team members buy
materials buy things and this process is
the central process here in this
occasion together with this because the work will be done by these resources and
it's very important why we do it here
and not here on on the on the planning
because I always try to do this as late
as possible because this is money so
resources I always wait until the last
minute of course look this is not
mathematics this is project management
so maybe sometimes there is a delay
between the time that you acquire the resources and the time they are
available for you so many times you need
to anticipate any starting some
procurement process and some acquisition process here of course for obvious
reasons then of course for the human
resources you acquired you will develop
a team and at the same time manage this
team another question you may ask me
what's the difference between develop
and manage develop the team is to make
the rest human resources you brought to
the project work together as a team
where 1+1 is more than to manage a team
it's more towards the operational
aspects what is operational aspects who
someone needs to take leave someone is
sick and cannot come so you manage the
daily work of your team so it's a very
very important process in this process
will happen during oh this occasion and
they will be a supporting pillar to the
to central product processes then after
that what I need to do I need to manage
my communications this is the execution
of your plan so remember you built a
plan base it on the stakeholders you
want to engage here is the time of you
making the meetings so when you say
where is the status report meeting it's
here exactly here in the managing
communications that will support your execution then after that you need to
implement risk responses Wow this is new
- this is new because here I'm learning
the risk responses here I'm implementing
let's suppose here I plan to buy an
insurance here I buy dangerous I'm
planning to change something in the
scope here is where I change things so
this is the actions related to the plans
and one thing together with the project
knowledge let me put a mark here this
are two new processes for the p.m.
böck guide sixth edition after that I
will conduct procurement by things
remember here you made a decision of
making buy if it's buy you need to come
here and buy it so you conduct all the
procurement processes based it on what
day is it exactly on how you plan your
procurement one important thing I said
about the twins here remember between
activity durations and resources twins
here between stakeholder management and
communication plan now I have the third set of twins conduct procurement and
acquire resources why because most of
the time the way you acquire resources
will require a procurement process so this are presented in two separate ways
but in reality they are all the same
thing because you need to buy a material
then you need to conduct the procurement to buy that material so this r2 process
that are very well connected last but
not least here in the siq you ssin you
manage the stakeholder engagement so
let's understand that identify my
stakeholders here I plan I understood
their power their influence their
interests and then I created a
communication plan to manage my
communication with them here I'm managing it's my process to engage these
stakeholders working or do I need to
change let's suppose that I have a group
that is very resistant to my project it
is my approach working with them or not
or should I change should I change my
approach maybe I'm sending okay write a
written report maybe I should call I
don't know so but here you need to see
what is happening with the stakeholder
engagement is it something changing here
for example someone is gain power losing
in
so you manage your stakeholders here these are Disick yueshen process and
then we move to the monitoring and
controlling process that will work
together with this ik you show on the
monitoring and controlling I am doing
things in parallel here I'm doing the
work here and making sure that the work
I'm doing here is okay remember I
started with integration integration and
integration what I will start here integration and what do I do
I will monitor and control the work so
here I'm managing and directly I'm
assigning tasks running with the
resources towards the results here I'm
saying is it everything okay it's the
time I was planning here on the on the
schedule is it working or not
second I need to perform the integrated
control change this is a really really
really really important process and why
this process is so important because
your project will face changes a hundred
percent sure of that there is no way
that what you estimate that here will
happen perfectly because the word has so
many variabilities that it's just
impossible so what do you need you need
to manage this changes you need to
understand and the second word that it's extremely important here is this
integrated the integrated means I'm not
only working scope time cost quality I'm
working on everything and if there is a
change how I can make this change in the
way that you it will be great for the
project not great for scope for example
but great for the project as a whole
and then what I need to do I need to do
a series of work the first work I need
to do is basically basically I need to
validate the scope and then control the
scope so I need to validate and people
what's the difference here
it's just that check I check the scope
that's here define it in the scope
statement was delivered and if something
is different I need to control the scope
remember all these words starting with
control are subsets with disintegrated
so here I'm concerned about changes in
the scope of the project for example I
was building a house and when I see I'm
not building a house anymore I'm building a restaurant whoops what's
going on here the second it's of course
and obvious let me just leave here make
this group here on the scope and attach
this to the integration then the second
one is control scandal is it something
going wrong am i becoming late is there
any issue on time remember here I have a
schedule but maybe things are not
perfect so here I can't remember here
the focus is on time here scope control
scope control scatter and this will be
added to this integrated change control
then I need to control costs so look
look did you see did you see one thing
that there is a lot of repetition in different areas so when you read you
need to understand because if you
understood one you understood oh because
they are just different topics so here
let's suppose let's give an example
let's suppose that you estimate that
cost look
seven point to base it on a resource
then you did on 12 point to a
procurement process to hired or to buy
this resource and then the resource was
much more expensive than what you expected then you start running over
budget then you need to control this
cost so this is exactly how things work
here it's a it's a very very fluid
process then you need to control quality
all tasks related to changes in quality
will be here most of the total quality
management tasks they are here most of
the statistical process are here so you
need to control the quality right
because when you are managing the
quality here they are different from
what you expect on your quality
management plan so look it's a very very
fluid then you need to control resource
ops for those with the PMBOK fifth
edition this is a new process okay
new process together with implement risk
response and manage project knowledge so
the culture resource what do I mean by
that do I need to add more resources we
need to reduce are the resources
performing in level that I want after
that I need to monitor communications
remember let's go to the communication
understand the communication process
look here I have a plan 10.1 that is
based on a certain stakeholder
engagement 13.2 then during the process
I manage I issue the reports the
meetings whatever the phone calls and
then I manage this stakeholder but maybe I need to change then I monitor because
this I may update my plan or maybe I
will update the way I manage so it's
exactly what I'm looking here then in
parallel this all happens at the same
time in a very fluid way and monitor risks why because some risks
that I thought oh they are no for
example here I did a qualitative risk
analysis on eleven point three say it's
low but something happens and the risks
became very very high let me give you a
very quick example let's suppose that
I'm importing some products and let's suppose that this products will be
arriving close to the end of the year
and let's suppose that the customs of my
country decide to say I will close my
operations between 15th of December and
15th of January this will increase
dramatically your probability of having
the product late so you need to monitor
because the risks they change everything
look look on TV what happens every day
on TV things change when we are talking
about monitoring risks then after that
we need to control my procurement what
is this this is where I make payments I
receive goods I receive service so all
the process that it's based on the
procurements I did on this occasion so
this are working together and of course
very close to monitor communications
very close to monitor communications
item ten point three I need to monitor
stakeholder engagement
why because stakeholders may change so
I'm managing and changing and look this
again this to process they are happening
almost at the same time in a very very
integrated way remember here I may be
come back so one thing that I'm super
concerned when I'm teaching this is that
people think and think wrongly that this
is you know written on stone that when
you do this you never come back look one
more time this is wrong and this is why
I'm telling you despite of of several common this is
very a
child 2 this is absolute it's so agile
that TMI on the PM bak release it the
agile practice together with this to
show how agile components can be use it
here can be used it here but of course
if you think that you write a
requirement and then it's over or that
this is just putting on paper that then
you are in trouble
but understand one thing these are very fluid and they do not need to be very
large formal but it's a more a mental
process for example I'm just talking to
you and presenting this and this seems to me extremely logical so I initiate a
plan as a queue to monitor and then I go
to the closing process so after doing
this so let's suppose that my project is
over I deliver so the the stakeholder
the client received the product so now
what I need to do I need to go to the
closing process in the closing process
process is basic on one integration
process that is closed project or phase
Y project or phase because I can use
this for the project or for just one piece of the product I can do this for
every single piece like a rolling wave
and here I will include all the work I
need to do I need to celebrate I need to
hand out the documents and this what is
very very important here is that in the
past it used to have another process
here called closing procurement and this
process disappeared and was incorporated
here so the closing is just this close
project of phase to simplify and to
unify that here you are closing basically everything so if you see the
old 47
47 boxes became now 49 y 49 47 plus the
three new ones 50 minus this one
49 so this is the full set of the PM BOC
guide now what I want to suggest you so
how you can learn this in a very simple
and direct way I want to invite you
please go to my website download this
the link is below download this download
this pieces ok they are importing is in
English put the tape in the back and
just play and have fun try to do it
alone
try to understand and with the p.m. BOC
guide in your hands you can say plan
procurement management I mean not sure
about what is that you can go and read a little bit more you will understand the
logic and everything that I showed to
you today its logic its nimble and it's
a child it's a job unfortunately a lot
of people misunderstand this and they
spend all the time just producing this
it's it's like an ideology forget that
what is relevant is you delivering your
project I used hundreds of aspects of
agile and hundreds of aspects of this it
depends on which kind of project I'm
doing how I'm doing the project sometimes I do all the parts sometimes I
do less but this is a guideline it's
exactly you start you plan you executed
control and you're close in a very
simple way but you don't need to say oh
I'm not following the PM bak right because I'm not doing item 94.4 don't do
that don't waste your time thinking
about that remember the framework exists
to support your project and not your
life exists to support the framework
think about that have fun test this and
then you can read and understand the PM
Bach and all this process flow in a very
very easy way one last thing remember
that the air of that goes both sides
this is exactly why I don't want you to
consider this waterfall because the
water that falls that it's not come back
here what I'm telling to you and ANSI is
telling to you and P it's that
everything can come back and most of the
time everything comes back to be fix it
because the the perfect conditions do
not exist your project think about that
practice and good look
