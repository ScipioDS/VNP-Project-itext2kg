for anyone studying for the PMP or new to project management or even just wanting to brush up on their project
management skills you'll probably come across the process groups practice guide from the project management Institute
which is actually an updated version of the project management body of knowledge sixth edition now there's a seventh
edition now which has gone in a completely different direction but they've morphed this into the process groups practice guide now this is one of
the most valuable things you could ever have as a project manager because it is a series of steps and process steps from
start to finish on how to run your project and what better way to learn a book and go through a book than to
actually create a mind map or a work breakdown structure of the inner workings of this particular book this is
what we're going to do now and it's going to really help you absorb the process groups practice guide and take
your project management to the next level as with any good mind map or work breakdown structure we're going to start
at a very high level high level ideas and then we're going to get more detailed and then more detailed and then
more detailed again it's a wonderful way to learn let's get into it the first thing you'll notice are there are two
sections a project management overview just so we understand the lay of the land and then the process itself for the
project management overview that's where we're going to start we start with an overview of the project landscape the
project management environment and the role of the project manager themselves
for the process we start with initiating planning a project executing a project
monitoring and controlling a project project and then closing a project let's start at the beginning overview of
projects we start with the importance of project management now it's important because without a project manager
organizing all of the little bits and pieces then they often scatter and Things Fall Apart projects themselves
Drive change we go from one state to the next state hopefully adding business
value as we go a project is also a temporary Endeavor it has a start and an
end and it drives business value so drives that change we also have projects
uh programs and portfolios the operational level is our business as usual or baau projects make a change
then multiple projects form a program and then multiple programs form a
portfolio and that also encompasses the operations uh when we when we come down
to it project life cycles and phases this is where we've got our predictive uh iterative incremental and adaptive so
agile and waterfall basically and you've got your waterfall which is your step-by-step requirements analysis
design coding testing and putting all of that into ba or operations so we choose
the life cycle the Project Life Cycle that's going to fit our project the best
as we go along on our project management Journey we collect data and we refine
that and turn that into meaningful information that we can share with Executives and other project
stakeholders we want to tailor our project tailoring the project is very important because each project will be a
little bit different managing benefits and project success measures we want to start with the end in mind so we really
want to have an idea of where the project is going and the value that we're delivering and we have a project
Charter to kick off our project and a project management plan to manage the project as we go along now in the
project management environment there are two main things that you'll come across quite a lot and that is the Enterprise
environmental factors or e defs and organizational process assets or opas
these are process assets that uh that are within the organization so processes uh governance templates things like that
the environment that we're working in includes the way work gets done so politics uh maybe different products
just have different ways of working for example you can create a car step by step but a software product you might
need to do an iterative approach so that's the environment that we're working in is it physical is it uh
software all that sort of thing these are all differences and that's why we tailor our project organizational and
project governance so we do need to understand the organizational governance and how work gets done and also the
project governance and how the work gets done within the project this includes man management elements so us as
managers and managers within the organization but also organizational structures there are different ones here
so these uh range from a high level of influence the where the project manager has a high level of influence to a low
level of influence and what we've got is a project management office or project oriented organizational structure we the
or the project manager has a high level of influence in these ones because it's all about the pmo and the projects then
we've got a matrix strong to weak organization so strong we still have a high level of influence but as it gets
weaker then we have a low level of influence we don't really do the budgeting maybe the budget is given to
us by by someone external maybe the functional manager and as we go down to the functional and organic then
functional managers are usually running the show and they might be doing a small process Improvement within their team so
that often they'll just have an ad hoc project manager or someone within their team doing it there are different pmo
types project management organizations or offices sorry they might be directive controlling or supportive directive
takes control over the whole thing controlling gives Frameworks and ideas and ways of working and says operate
Within These Frameworks and supportive just gives templates and says here here are some ideas and you can use these if
you really want to we're here to support you now what does the role of the man role of the project manager play Within
all of these things we've got our own sphere of influence so we can influence our own project team but then there are
governing bodies there's the project management office steering committees and that's a little bit outside of our
uh of our sphere of influence but still within it and then we've got our industry suppliers customers and that's
often outside of our sphere of influence but we still need to negotiate and influence them using our own personal
power project manager competencies that we'll need are power skills so soft skills business Acumen we need to
understand the business that we're working in and the ways of working which is this particular process and the project management process groups we'll
also need the qualities and skills of a leader there are different leadership types from servant leadership to
directive leadership to LZ Fair leadership hands off all sorts of different way
and Performing integration is where we take all of these process steps and we integrate them all together and we
become that binding glue for our project as the project manager now we get to go
into the process and we'll give a high level overview here and then as I promised with the with that work
breakdown structure approach we will get into the nitty-gritty of each one so first we develop a project Charter to
kick off our project and we identify all of the stakeholders that we need to work with then we create our project
management plan and this is part of the that plan that keeps everything together and in that plan we want to plan our
scope so we gather that scope collect the requirements Define the scope and then create our work breakdown structure
for all of that scope that we have have elicited from our customers once we have that we can start planning our schedule
we Define the activities from the scope that we found sequence those activities put them into a nice sequence here using
a using a schedule Network diagram then we estimate the activity durations so
how long will each one take and once we have all of those bits of information we can develop the schedule and put those
on a nice Gant chart once we have our scope and our schedule then we can look at the cost so planning cost management
how are we going to work with cost on our project then we estimate the costs for all of those different activities
and different parts of scope and then we use that to determine the budget now there's a bit more to it than that but
we'll go into that a little bit later then we can plan quality so how are we doing quality assurance or testing
planning Resource Management how are we getting people and who are we getting we need to estimate the resources that we
need planning Communications management how are we uh communicating with our customers and with our stakeholders
planning risk management we need to identify the risks perform qualitative risk analysis quantitative risk analysis
which is much more data heavy and then plan the risk responses how are we going to respond to those risks that we find
that might impact our project planning procurement management is how we operate with with vendors and planning
stakeholder engagement is how we keep our stakeholders engaged now the rest of these processes at a high level is just
the same knowledge groups so scope schedule planning cost uh quality resources Communications risk
procurement and stakeholders uh but now we're just executing and Performing these tasks we're directing and managing
the project work we're managing quality we're acquiring the resources that we need developing and managing our team
we're managing Communications to make sure that the communications are effective implementing risk responses as
those risks come up conducting procurements getting those vendors on board and managing our stakeholder
engagement to keep our stakeholders engaged and then we need to control our project and keep everything under
control the same deal uh the the main differences here are we have change
control which is uh change management process so how do we make sure that if there's a change in the scope that uh
it's approved and it's doesn't impact our project schedule or it doesn't impact our project cost or if it does
then that's approved the other thing is validating scope is once we've uh once we've uh created those deliverables and
finished them then they need to be signed off by whoever the customer is usually a project sponsor or whoever is
receiving that particular deliverable the rest we just Monitor and control risks quality resources procurements and
stakeholder engagement and then when we're closing we can close a project or it could just be a project phase and
then we do all of this again for the next phase if we're working in an iterative method or an iterative way of
work now all of this as you can see we've got uh the first one all the way
back at the beginning developing project Charter this goes down another level again so developing project Charter in
the process groups practice guide we might have inputs to that particular process the tools that we use for that
particular process and then the outputs so what are we trying to get by doing develop project Charter and this is
where the real gold lies so if you've seen enough already at this point then feel free to stop this video and leave
but if you want to get into the nitty-gritty of all of these inputs tools and outputs for each process then
continue watching and really get the the goods for the rest of these processes let's see what we've got for develop
project Charter the inputs we need business documents so we need a business case so is it actually worth doing the
project in the first place we also need a benefits management plan because we need to know what the benefits for the
project are going to be and how we're going to manage them we might have agreements in the business already and then Enterprise environmental factors
what's the environment that we're working in and organizational process assets is there a tool or technique or a
template that is already existing for our project Charter that we can use in the organization the tools that we're
going to use are expert judgment we might need people from the industry who understand the product so we're going to
need their expertise data Gathering brainstorming with them focus groups interviews making sure we're Gathering
all that data on the pros and cons of the project interpersonal and team skills Conflict Management maybe people
have competing ideas facilitation facilitating those groups of people and
meeting management and then meetings themselves and the output that we're looking for is the project Charter
itself so we're creating that project project Charter getting it signed off with the project sponsor and any
assumptions that we've made along the way let's include those as well now the next one when we're initiating a project
is identifying all the stakeholders that we're going to be working with so to do that we're going to need the project
Charter that's going to have a high level idea of the stakeholders and business documents the business case and
the benefits management plan will also have a nice idea project management plan as we start to create that project
management plan we're going to have stakeholders in there so we can refer to that we might need the communications
management plan stakeholder engagement plan all of this will have ideas of the stakeholders that we're working with and
project documents change log issue log requirements documentation all of this will give us stakeholder ideas any prior
agreements within the organization and of course the environment and any templates that are already existing for
identifying stakeholders as always we're going to need expert judgment from people within the business who knows who
Maybe we need them to give us an idea of the stakeholders that we need on our project we need to gather data with
questionnaires and surveys to identify stakeholders stakeholder analysis and document analysis and data
representation we need stakeholder mapping and representation now I can't go into these in a lot of detail for
that you have to check out my course on PMP which will also give you 35 contact hours or pdus which is really really
fantastic but just know that this is the level that it goes down to and uh in that course we actually go into and show
what each of those particular items is we're going to need meetings and the output for identifying stakeholders is
our stakeholder register with all of our stakeholders input into it we might need
change requests and project management plan updates as we update with new stakeholders and project documents
updates like assumptions issues or risk registers that have new stakeholders involved now we're going to move into
the planning project and this is the biggest part of the process groups practice guide for developing the
project management plan we're going to need the project Charter now this needs to be signed off by the project sponsor
so is it approved to go ahead do we have the resources do we have the high level idea of the project and what's involved
any output from other processes so scope schedule all of these things cost that's
going to go into our project management plan and of course the environment that we're working in the industry or the
organization and any process uh templates or process assets uh that we
might have that will give us a clue on how to create our project management plan the tools and techniques we're
going to need expert judgment from people within the organization who know about the project and things that we
might need for our project management plan data Gathering focus groups checklists interviews and interpersonal
and team skills Conflict Management as we create our project management plan and meetings to facilitate all of those
things the outputs are the project management plan itself and we'll be updating this as our project goes along
now as we move through planning we've got planning scope management what we need for planning scope management is
the project Charter the high level scope in there and the project management plan and of course our environment and opas
our process assets for managing scope expert judgment as always data analysis
and then of course meetings to tie all that together and the outputs are our scope management plan which is the
process for how we're managing scope and I have a great bunch of templates for uh scope management plan and entire the
entire project management plan plan process actually pre-made with all of these little prompts for the process
groups and and how to do it step by step so those are really really wonderful check out the description if you want to
get those ready made and it'll save you dozens and dozens of hours of doing it yourself the requirements management
plan is how we're going to manage the requirements now once we've got the process set up we want to collect the
requirements themselves we're going to need the project Charter so what are the high level requirements the project
management plan project documents so stakeholders and assumptions business documents the business case will have
high level requirements already that we can use any agreements within the business and of course our Enterprise
environmental factors and opas for any templates and the environment that we're working in tools and techniques people's
expert judgment as always data Gathering data analysis decision- making data
Gathering data representation interpersonal and team skills again to
elicit all of those requirements and gather them from our stakeholders we can use context diagrams to put these
together and prototypes so mockups or storyboards or models all of these things and again I can't go into all of
those details at that level for this one but in the uh PMP course I certainly do
which is pretty cool if you want to check that out requirements documentation so the output is the is
the acceptance criteria for each of the items and the requirements that we're wanting to be delivered and then a
requirements traceability Matrix how we how have we got the requirements through to the deliverables through to their
test cases through to uh the approvals and sign offs and we're tracking that from start to finish once we've got the
requirements we can start defining the scope that we're going to deliver in our project and that looks like we start
with our project Charter the project management plan and project documents for any assumptions and of course our
environment and any process assets that will help us along the way tools and Techniques expert judgment from people
within the business as always data analysis uh so any alternatives for our
scope decision making multicriteria decision- making which is my favorite way to make decisions by the way and
I've got wonderful templates for that if you want to check that out uh we're going to need to facilitate all of these
things and bring that together together so that we can put that scope together for our project and then product
analysis we want to analyze our product and figure out which direction it needs to go in the outputs are our project
scope statement so that's just a high level scope statement and project documents including the requirements
documentation and so we're sort of updating those things updating stakeholders and updating the requirements traceability Matrix as we
plan we're now creating the work breakdown structure similar to what we're doing for the process groups
practice guide but for this it's a project and the inputs that we're going to need the scope management plan to
figure out the process on how we're doing what we're doing for scope project documents and requirements documentation
of course we're going to need our environment and any process assets to help us along the way tools and
techniques or surprise surprise it's expert judgment from people within the business so we're going to need that and
of course decomposition which is decomposing these things into more
detailed and more detailed levels similar to what we're doing with this particular exercise which is really
really great the scope Baseline is our output and project documents updates
planning schedule this is another great one now we've got the scope we can move on to planning our schedule the inputs
that we're going to need for this are the project Charter so high level Milestones that we might have outlaid
the project management plan and of course the environment that we're working in and any uh assets or process
assets that we have within the business that might help us plan our schedule so the systems or tools that we might have
expert judgment from people within the business surprise surprise we're probably going to see this a lot by the looks of it analyzing data and meetings
to tie it all together and the output that we're looking for is to create our schedule management plan which is the
process for how we're going to manage our schedule once we've done that and we've got our process we can start
defining the activities now can you guess what we're going to need as inputs for this well first of all the project
management plan so the schedule management plan and the scope Baseline this is the most important one because
we're going to take that scope Baseline and the work breakdown structure and the work packages and we're going to need to
turn those into activities so we're going to use expert judgment we're going
to use decomposition because we're going to decompose those work packages into activities so further rolling wave
planning is something we can use that's an agile technique there's much more to it but you know that's an idea meetings
to tie it all together and the outputs that we want are the list of activities themselves for the project the activity
attributes so the resources cost and all of these things that we'll add as we go
further and further through our project plan the Milestone list just a high level list of Milestones that we're
going to adhere to on our project we might have change requests as we go along and project management plan
updates so the schedule Baseline will be updated as we Define the activities and change those activities once we have
that list of activities we want to put them in the right sequence exactly right
so to do that what are we going to need the project management plan and we want the schedule management plan our process
the scope Baseline and all of those activity lists and attributes and of course the environment so are we
creating software or are we creating a car or or a chair or anything else or a
vacuum cleaner all of these things and of course the process assets do we have a way to sequence activities in the
organization already that we can already use tools and techniques the Precedence
diagramming method dependency determination and integration which activities are dependent on each other
leads and lags and of course we're going to need our project management information system so that holds all of
the project data that we're going to be working with project schedule Network diagrams are things like the nodes so if
these are the activities what is the sequence that we need to do these in and
then project updates activity attributes we might need to update those as we go along once we've got that activity list
and we've put them in sequence we need to estimate their durations so how long is are these activities going to take
it's very important for us to know this even though it's just an estimate at this time so we're going to need the
project management plan project documents so all of these things the activity list now tools and techniques
we going to need the expert judgment as always of people in the organization but here are the estimating techniques and
and these are absolutely my favorite so analagous estimating which is uh something similar to another feature or
another project it's an analogy parametric estimating where it's say a dollar per meter or $10 per hour it's
it's a parameter threo estimating is optimistic uh pessimistic and most
likely and we get all those three together and we just divide it by three it's just an average basically and again
we go into that in all the detail in the project management professional course but uh that's just one way to do it
bottom up estimating is gathering all of the work packages and then uh Gathering them up to the next level and then that
those levels to the next level until we have an overall project budget we're going to need data analysis to do all of
that decision- making and meetings as always to tie it all together now the
outputs that we're going to have are the duration estimates and the base of estimates so how did we come to those
estimate decisions and updating any activity attributes and assumptions that we've made along the way now that we've
estimated those activity durations we want to develop the overall schedule so the things that we're going to need are
our project management plan project documents agreements and of course the environment and opas as always the tools
and techniques that we're going to need are our schedule network analysis so that's our where everything the the
sequence of where everything fits the critical path method so this is where we determine uh the critical path so the
shortest time that we can complete our project resource optimization data analysis so what if scenario analysis
leads and lags again bringing items leading them forward or lagging behind
schedule compression So that's fast tracking or or schedule crashing project
management information system where we house all that all of that data and Agile Release planning where we're
planning for the next small increment in an agile project the outputs that we're going to have are the schedule Baseline
itself the project schedule schedule data and project calendars change requests for the future if we need to
make any changes project management plan updates to our schedule management plan and project documents updates now that
we have our schedule we can start planning cost because we know what what our scope is and how long it's going to
take now we can get an idea for how much how much it's going to cost cost and the inputs for this are our project Charter
so the initial high level cost that we had in mind the project management plan and of course our EFS and opas well it's
a we're always going to see those I think lots and lots of those every process that we see expert judgment is
the other thing that we're going to see a lot of and data analysis for our tools and techniques so Alternatives analysis
do we have different ways of managing our cost and meetings to tie it all
together as always the output for this one is our cost management plan the process for how we're going to manage
cost on our project now we've got that we can estimate the costs and the inputs
so how do we start by estimating our costs we need our project management plan project documents Lessons Learned
project schedule and surprise surprise it's EFS and opas wow what a what a
surprise seeing them there and also another surprise expert judgment from people associated with cost or budgeting
in the organization and then the different estimating methods of course analogous parametric
bottom up three-point estimating data analysis to tie all that together in our estimates cost of quality now that's a
really good one and again don't have time to go into that in lots of detail but cost of quality is a good one to
understand what's the cost of preventing quality issues or or catching them before they get to the customer all of
those things project management information system where we house all of that data and information for our project and decision making we might
vote on uh how much things cost to get the best outcome there the outputs we
want are our cost estimates themselves the basis of those estimates so what did we base those estimates on and project
documents updates now of course we want to determine the budget itself so the inputs that we're going to need are our
project management plan project documents business documents any agreements in the organization already
and EFS and opas expert judgment so all of that from the right people within the business or the organization or the
project cost aggregation where we're taking all of those the costs for the work packages aggregating them up into
larger uh larger items features or deliverables and aggregating those up into an overall project budget then we
need to analyze that management reserves and contingency reserves that will form part of our budget and again go into
more more detail for that one in the PMP course uh historical information review so any historical information on past
projects for analogous estimating funding limit reconciliation we
obviously want to reconcile the budget uh the debits and credits and then
financing the budget itself where is the money coming from the outputs that we want are the cost Baseline the approved
budget Project funding requirements maybe there's milestones and they're released at certain times and project
documents updates now that we've got our scope schedule and cost we can start looking at quality so how do we plan
quality on our project we need our project Charter project management plan project documents EFS and opas tools and
techniques surprise surprise it's expert judgment from people within the business
data Gathering we can use benchmarking against other teams or organizations stuff like that it's really good stuff
data analysis decision making and that's multi criteria decision analysis which
is my absolute favorite great way to prioritize features in an agile project
too data representation or mind mapping which we're becoming pretty familiar
with in a roundabout way uh by doing this particular process test and inspection planning so the acceptance
criteria against the requirements and the test cases themselves and of course
meetings to tie it all together the outputs we want are our quality management plan our quality management
process quality metrics how do we know when we're successful uccessful project management plan and project documents
updates and of course updating that requirements traceability Matrix now that we've got quality under control we
can start planning the resources on our project so how do we do that well we're going to need our project Charter we
might have a high level idea of project resources that we had promised to us at
the beginning when the project kicked off the project management plan for Quality Management plan and scope
Baseline the project documents and EFS and opas as always seeing a lot of those
and again expert judgment for the the right people at the right time planning
the resources getting their input and ideas data representation hierarchical
charts we might need a resource breakdown structure organizational Theory oh now this is amazing I love
this and again there's a lot of this in the PMP course but this is how do we grow our team and how do we get the best
psychological Ally out of our team and make sure that everyone is happy and engaged like herzberg's theory of
motivation for example ai's Theory Zed or Z for those in America wonderful
wonderful stuff meetings as always to tie it all together and the outputs are
our Resource Management plan which is our resource management process exactly
right the team charter so how is our team going to work together project document updates and these ones are
extras that I think I have uh added inadvertently but we want to update assumptions and risks as always now that
we've planned Resource Management we can start estimating the resources that we need for our project and you'll remember
the estimating techniques that we have but first we need our project management plan project documents EFS and opas uh
and the tools and Techniques expert judgement from the right people and then bottomup estimating analogous estimating
parametric estimating and all of those things can help us estimate those resources data analysis to analyze the
Alternatives that we need and then all of that information on our project is in our project management information
system and that could be a system like SharePoint or jira or it could be
Microsoft Project many different things whatever that system is it's always different meetings as always to tie it
all together the outputs are our resource requirements and we now we've got the basis of those estimates the
resource breakdown structure like we said which is that hierarchical chart we're going to update the activity
attributes assumptions and any lessons that we learn along the way now that we've done that we want to plan the
communications on our project for all of those stakeholders and communicating how things are going the project Charter
project management plan project documents EFS and opas will all form an input here tools that we're going to use
are expert judgment communication requirements analysis so how do people prefer to be communicated with
communication technology maybe it's phones maybe it's over the Internet maybe it's messaging tools communication
models now this is a really good thing uh many different ways to communicate and many different things to be aware of
when we communicate so there's a whole bunch of great information on that one
communication methods interpersonal and team skills data representation and of course meetings to tie it all together
the outputs that we want here are our Communications management plan project management plan updates and project
documents updates CU we might be updating our stakeholder engagement plan and how they want to be communicated
with now we can plan risk management so planning risk management what what are we going to need as an input the project
Charter for any high level risks project management plan project documents EFS
and opas as always uh surprise surprise for tools and techniques we're going to
to need expert judgment data analysis for stakeholders and the risks that they might come up with and meetings to tie
it all together outputs is the risk management plan or the risk management
process so that's what we've got there then we can identify all of the risks and we do that by brainstorming with our
team so we need our project management plan for our risk management approach for example project documents for any
issues or cost estimates or things that might uh bring risks to our project any
agreements that we've made within the business already project documentation EFS and opas to help us identify risks
we're going to need the right expert judgment from the right people uh maybe that's people within the business who know the product well or the the area
well maybe it's uh uh data Engineers or software Engineers who have that information that can help us uh identify
risks data Gathering brainstorming with those people data analysis doing root
cause analysis and facilitating prompt lists so we might have categories of
risks that will help us or they're prompt prompting us for risks that we might have and of course meetings to tie
it all together the outputs that we have are is the risk register itself the list of risks and their categorization risk
report which we send out to stakeholders on a regular basis just to to make sure that they're up to date on any project
risks and the project documents updates any assumptions or issues that come up
along the way performing qualitative risk analysis is the subjective method
so this is where we usually look at our risks by the impact and likelihood and
then we uh determine how severe those risks are going to be we're going to need our project management plan project
documents EFS and opas as part of that expert judgment from the right people
data Gathering data analysis interpersonal and team skills risk Cate
categorization which is what we said here the impact and the likelihood data
representation we put that into a probability and impact Matrix and meetings to tie all of those things
together as always the outputs we want are project documents updates now
quantitative risk analysis is Where We Gather lots and lots of data to to give
more information to the risks that are happening that could be financial data it could be data on the weather for
example I've seen in some insurance-based C companies on global warming um big simulations and Monte
Carlo analysis this is we're going to need our project management plan project documents EFS and opas as always expert
judgment data Gathering interpersonal and team skills representations of
uncertainty and data analysis all of those things are for our tools and techniques representations of
uncertainty that could be things like a histogram so now we see where the majority of the risks are coming from in
this area here just as one example outputs the project documents updates we're going to need to update our risk
report as we send that out on a regular basis to our stakeholders now once we've
got all of that information with risk we can plan the risk responses how are we
going to respond we're going to need our project management plan project documents EFS and opas as always the
tools and techniques surprise surprise it's our expert judgment from the right people data Gathering interpersonal and
team skills strategies for threats strategies for opportunities contingent
response strategies so any leftover risks or or alternative risk strategies
strategies for overall project risk data analysis might include cost benefit
analysis on our responses and decision-making my favorite multicriteria decision analysis the
outputs we want here we might have some change requests as we manage our risks and their responses project management
plan updates and project documents updates all of these things can be updated schedule cost scope might change
as we respond to risks and they change the way we approach our project now
lastly in planning we can plan procurement management this is where
we're needing a vendor to come on board and we could start with our project Charter because we might already have
allocated a vendor or get gotten an idea of a vendor that's going to be required for our project business documents
project management plan project documents like any Milestones that we need project team assignments if we've
already assigned a vendor requirements documentation so the vendor can see what
they're going to need to deliver and EFS and opas expert judgment I bet you weren't
expecting that one um data Gathering data analysis Source selection and
analysis is how we're going to approve the vendors and so we've got our criteria and then the vendors just need
to meet that criteria in order to be approved and meetings to tie all of that
together outputs are our procurement management plan which is our procurement management process exactly the strategy
for procurement bid documents so request for information uh request for quote
request for proposal procurement statement of work so that's the list of items that we're
delivering Source selection criteria so uh how we're approving any vendors
what's our source selection criteria make or buy decisions independent cost estimates so we know so we have an idea
if something is worthwhile or not change requests project document updates and organizational process assets updates
that we might come across oh lastly as well we going to need to plan stakeholder engagement where we need our
project Charter for any initial stakeholders project management plan project documents any organizational
agreements that are already in place EFS and opas the tools and techniques are
expert judgment data Gathering data analysis decision- making data representation and meetings as always
outputs is the stakeholder engagement plan itself which is our stakeholder engagement process so now we can move on
to executing a project so actually doing the work directing and managing our
Project work what we're going to need is our project management plan because this is how we've planned everything out
project documents like our change log project Communications and approved change
requests for any changes that go along EFS and opas we will need expert
judgment as we execute our project and we'll need all of the information from our project management information
system again could be Confluence SharePoint could be uh anything jira could be uh monday.com could be assana
could be anything that your company is using could be Excel even meetings to tie it all together and the outputs we
want the deliverables themselves this is where we're delivering the project work work performance data so how is
everything tracking the raw data issue log for any issues that come up change
requests for any changes that need to be made project management plan updates project document updates and
organizational process assets updates as we're executing the project we're going to manage project knowledge so the
project management plan project documents and the deliverables themselves will all form an input into
managing our project knowledge because as we learn things we need to make sure that that is captured tools and
Techniques expert judgement as always Knowledge Management so how are we managing the knowledge on our project
information management how are we managing information where are we capturing all of those things and
interpersonal and team skills so for facilitation and Leadership to gather
and extract all of those lessons the outputs that we want here are our lessons learned register project
management plan updates and organizational process assets updates managing quality so to manage quality as
we execute our project uh the inputs that we're going to need are our project management plan so again this is our
quality management process that we have already planned out project documents
lessons or quality metrics risks that come up and organizational process assets for templates or tools tools for
managing quality are checklists data analysis Alternatives analysis decision-
making multicriteria decision analysis data representation and again lots more information in the in the full course on
PMP that you can definitely go into or find information separately on those things and how to use those tools and
templates auditing designing for X which is designing for a particular idea like
ease of use for example or ease of assembly problem solving quality
improvement methods so can we improve uh our quality process and the quality of
the item itself the outputs that we want are quality reports the test and evaluation documents so the outputs of
our testing change requests if we need if we've got defects that need to go back through and be uh be worked on
again project management plan updates and project documents updates now that we're executing our
project we can acquire the resources and the inputs that we're going to need are our project management plan our Resource
Management plan if you could guess project documents EFS and opas the tools
and techniques that we can use are decision- making interpersonal and team skills so multicriteria decision- making
or negotiation as we negotiate uh the Gathering of resources with our business
or with the business that we're working with pre-assignment if people have already been assigned to the project and
virtual teams if we're working uh around the country with many different teams in different areas we might work virtually
or online the outputs that we have are the physical resource assignments uh so that's the materials and then the
project team assignments so that's the people resource calendars when are people available change requests project
management updates project documents updates EF and opa updates now that
we've acquired our team we can develop the team and the inputs that we want are our project management plan project
documents EFS and opas so the resource management plan was our process for how we were going to do this we can now
refer to that process lessons learned that we've learned along the way and the team charter for how we're working with
our team tools and techniques that we're going to use include collocating our
team so getting everyone together in the same space so that we can communicate quickly and easily virtual teams if we
are geographically dispersed communication technology messaging tools uh telephone tools video conferencing
tools Conflict Management influencing motivating negotiating and team building
all of that we'll need to manage conflict within our team as we develop them recognition and rewards for the
right things training our team to help them grow individual and team assessments to uh to see how they are
traveling and of course meetings to tie all of those things together as our
project management manager as you can tell uh we spend a lot of time in meetings by the looks of it lots of
meetings in all those uh tools and techniques the outputs that we've got are the team performance assessments so
how are we assessing our team how are they going change requests if we need to make a change project management plan
updates to any resources project documents updates Enterprise environmental factors and opa updates
that we might need once we've start developing our team we can manage the team as we go through our project with
the project management plan project documents work performance reports team performance assessments that we've
gathered EFS and opas and of course the process comes from our Resource
Management plan we're going to need tools like interpersonal and team skills for Conflict Management the outputs
include change requests for changes project management plan updates project documents updates and inv environmental
factors updates so we might update our process the resource management plan any issues that come about and project team
assignments if people need to be assigned differently or reassigned managing Communications on our project
as we execute our project will include needing our project management plan for our Communications process project
documents for issues or changes quality report risk report for risks work
performance reports how is our project going we'll need to communicate Comm unicate that to our stakeholders EFS and
opas tools and techniques will need communication technology so messaging
emails reporting how are we actually communicating communication methods so face Toof face uh or different methods
that we're using communication skills um so it could be non-verbal or
presentations how do we gather feedback project management information system where we gather all of our project
information project reporting we can use that to report and then uh gather
information for future communications interpersonal and team skills and of course meetings to tie all of that
together project communications project management plan updates project documents updates and organizational
process assets updates are all part of the outputs as we manage Communications
on our project implementing the risk responses we would need to look at the project management plan so our risk
management plan or our risk management process project documents Lessons Learned risks and risk reports that we
might need as we're implementing those risk responses and organizational process assets for any existing
templates for managing risk responses expert judgment influencing and data
from the project management information system are all tools that we can use change requests for any changes that
come about as we Implement those risk responses and project documents updates so the issues log for issues risk
register and the risk report as we send that out executing a project we're going to conduct the procurements for any
third-party vendor we'll need our procurement management plan as part of our project management plan project
documents project document procurement documentation so that could be our uh
proposals or request for proposal our statement of work source selection criteria all of those things seller
proposals We Gather them back from the sellers and then we can make a decision on who to proceed with and EFS and opas
tools and techniques we're going to need our expert judgment from the right people within the organization
advertising so can we get more sellers uh to give us requests for information
or requests for proposal bit conferences can we get everyone on the same page at
the same time data analysis and interpersonal and team skills the outputs that we're looking for are the
selected sellers themselves any agreements that we have or will need to make change requests if we're changing
the V or the timing project management plan updates project documents updates and organizational process assets
updates right at the very end of executing a project we're managing stakeholder engagement so we'll need our
stakeholder engagement plan project documents EFS and opas tools and
techniques include expert judgment communication skills to ensure that
we're engaging in the right way interpersonal and team skills ground rules within our Pro project and
meetings as always change requests if we need to change things uh in the way that
we manage with our stakeholders project management plan updates and project documents updates are all part of the
outputs for managing stakeholder engagement and now we can start moving on to monitoring and controlling so now
we're just controlling the project work before we finally close it off so the inputs that we're going to need are our
project management plan as always different aspects project documents Project work per performance information
that we've gathered as our project moves along and to see if we're on track or off track agreements Enterprise
environmental factors and organizational process assets tools and techniques we're going to need are expert judgment
from the right people data analysis decision making and meetings to tie it
all together outputs work performance reports so we turn that information into
reports that go to Executives or stakeholders uh in in our project change
requests project management plan updates and project documents updates so for any
issues or cost forecasts that we need to be updating we also want to perform integrated change control which is our
Change Control process we're going to need our project management plan project documents work performance reports
change requests EFS and opas tools and techniques we're going to need surprise
surprise expert judgment Change Control tools analysis decision making and
meetings outputs that we're going to want are the approved change requests themselves project management plan
updates and project documents updates so the change log we can update with the outputs of those change
requests also part of monitoring and controlling is validating that scope if you remember that's with our project
sponsor or the customer whoever is receiving the scope and the completed deliverable we will need our project
management plan project documents the verified deliverables that means they've been verified with our quality assurance
process work performance data about our project and that includes the quality process data inspections so we've
inspected the product and and we're happy with it decision- making the outputs we have here once it's been
signed off are our accepted deliverables the work performance information change
requests if we have any defects that need to go back and be worked on again project document update
we want to control scope as we're going along for any changes and of course we're going to need our project
management plan project documents work performance data from all of our project work and organizational process assets
the tools and techniques we're going to need are data analysis for Trend or or
variance analysis and the outputs will include that work performance information remember the data turns into
information and that goes into reports so that's how it goes there change
requests for any changes project management plan updates if we need to update our scope baseline or the scope
management plan and project documents updates for any Lessons Learned and of course our requirements traceability
Matrix controlling the schedule as that goes along if there are any changes for
Change Control where the inputs are the project management plan for the schedule management plan and our process project
documents work performance data and opas to tools and techniques include data
analysis the critical path method if that changes or we need to adjust our schedule the project management
information system is where we get all of our project information from uh resource optimization if we need to
change or Shuffle resources around to get the best outcome leads and lags for bringing things forward or moving them
back and schedule compression which is fast tracking or schedule crashing and
throwing resources and money at at the schedule to make it go faster work performance information is uh what comes
out of this schedule forecasts so we'll see if things are going on track change requests if we need to make a change
project management plan updates to our schedule baseline or cost Baseline and project documents updates controlling
costs is another thing that we're going to need to do and of course the inputs to this will include our project
management plan and project documents as always Project funding requirements that we had said in our plan the work
performance data for how we're tracking so we'll we'll compare these two things together to see if we need to make a
change organizational process assets as well for any templates expert judgment
for the people in the organization that we need to talk to about controlling costs data analysis two complete
performance Index this is part of our variance analysis and earned value management which we go into much more
detail in in the full course for project management project management information system where we gather all
of our project information work performance information is an output cost forecasts is an output change
requests can be an output updating our project management plan and project documents can also be an output of that
particular process controlling the quality this is where we've gone through quality process and maybe there's uh we
need to keep that quality under control so how do we do that project management plan will need as an input project
documents approved test cases so we're running different test cases uh to see
if the quality is there and it can be approved deliverables so we'll need those deliverables to test the work
performance data EFS and opas tools and techniques include data Gathering and
hey we haven't got expert judgment in here which is amazing so I think that's the first one data analysis inspection
so we're inspecting those deliverables testing and product evaluations
evaluating the product data representation so as we get the information we want to show it in a way
that our stakeholders will understand maybe a histogram maybe scatter diagrams
and meetings to uh usually to Showcase that information if we need to or get decisions quality control measurements
uh so that's the measurements what we were aiming for with quality is it 90% pass rate or whatever that is verified
deliverables so now we're verifying them so that the project sponsor can validate
them and approve them sign off on those deliverables like we saw before work performance information change requests
project management updates and project documents updates are all the outputs for controlling quality controlling our
resources and keeping that under control the inputs can you guess project management plan project documents work
performance data from our project uh to see if we're on track or off track any agreements that we've made with the
resources and and gaining those resources from the business organiz ational process assets for any templates
and ways of work uh tools and techniques that we're going to use are data analysis so cost benefit analysis for
example uh Trend analysis performance reviews on our people problem solving uh
interpersonal and team skills we might need to negotiate and influence to get the right resources project management
information system is where all of our project information comes from and goes into work performance information is an
output so how are our resources performing requests if we are off track
project management plan updates and project documents updates can all be an output of controlling resources
monitoring Communications is part of monitoring and controlling a project and the inputs can you guess project
management plan exactly project documents work performance data for how our project is tracking EFS and opas
expert judgment is something that we'll need as always project management information system system to get the information for how our project is
tracking data representation interpersonal and team skills and meetings again meetings one of those
things they are everywhere in our tools and techniques the outputs we want same as always when we're controlling a
project we might have change requests work performance information that uh that we can showcase to other people in
reports and project management plan updates and projected documents updates for issues risks stakeholder changes
now we want to monitor the risks on our project and keep them under control if we can the inputs will be our risk
management plan so our project management plan project documents for any risk registers or risk reports work
performance data for how we're traveling and work performance reports for previous reports that we've sent out to
our stakeholders data analysis Audits and meetings are all ways that we can
monitor those risks uh and make sure that they are kept under control Ro and
where the outputs that we have are the work performance information so turning that data into information that we can
use uh to make a decision change requests project management plan updates project document updates and
organizational process assets updates now we want to control procurements when
we're controlling and monitoring our project can you guess we're going to need our procurement management plan as
an input for our project management plan project documents agreements uh for any
procurements procurement documentation which is our statement of work any requests for proposals sellers that
we've got uh the the the vendor selection criteria approved change requests as we go along work performance
data EFS and opas tools and techniques surprise surprise it's expert judgment
claims Administration is if uh the vender is doing something and we don't like it or we don't agree that it's
correct and but they don't agree that it's wrong then it will go to a claim uh
data analysis inspection and audits because we're going to need to inspect and audit the things that the vendor does and make sure that it's correct the
outputs will be closing that procurement the work performance information to see if it was on track and what they
delivered procurement documentation updates change requests if it was off track project management plan updates
project documents updates and organizational process assets updates and monitoring stakeholder
engagement is still part of monitoring and controlling a project so our stakeholder engagement plan project
documents work performance data Enterprise environmental factors and organizational process assets as always
and data analysis will be a tool and technique decisionmaking data representation to represent the data on
our stakeholders so stakeholder engagement assessment Matrix communication skills for feedback or
presentations interpersonal and team skills meetings with our stakeholders outputs for monitoring stakeholder
engagement will be our work performance information change requests project management plan updates and project
documents updates and lastly you made it closing that project or closing that project phase how do we do this we need
our project Charter so what did we agree to at the very beginning did we meet what we agreed to the project management
plan project documents so all of these basis of estimates the Assumption logs did we meet what we said we were going
to do the accepted deliverables themselves the business documents any uh future agreements procurement
documentation for closed procurements and opas for any uh ways of working
expert judgment data analysis and meetings will help us in our tools and techniques for closing a pro project or
phase and the outputs will be project documents updates the lessons learned the final service or result or
transition and so that's the end of our project or phase the final report to
just let everyone know how it went and the outcomes and organizational process assets updates for any things that need
to go back into the business and that is all of those processes and the Really nitty-gritty information and detail for
those particular process groups in the practice guide I hope you've enjoyed it's been a wonderful Journey I'll see
you in the next video bye for now
