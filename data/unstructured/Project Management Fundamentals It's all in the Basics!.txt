you know what is interesting
a lot of the tasks activities things you
do at work are projects even though most
often you don't know that they're indeed
projects
now this creates a bit of a problem
right
problem for you
if you don't know what you have as a
project then obviously
how can you project manage it right i
mean so in effect what you're doing is
managing a project
without project management
right makes sense
now what is a project a project is a
temporary endeavor right to deliver a
certain outcome and output right and
that outcome um has has boundaries
around it which we call the scope right
it has a beginning
it has an end
it has a schedule right a budget
um
money right
and most importantly a scope right
and scope determines what you should and
should not deliver
now when you don't apply proper project
management like even very basic like
very very basic project management the
fundamentals of it
right
to your project then a few things happen
all the time
first and foremost you get pressure from
everyone around you yeah all your
stakeholders politics quality issues
scheduled demands and most importantly a
lot of conflict of interest right
because
conflict of interest is is a symptom
it's a symptom of what happens when
you're running a project but you don't
know that it's a project and therefore
you're lost right as a symptom
all the stakeholders start demanding
more right they feel more entitled
your clients your suppliers your
managers your peers right people report
to you your team members because there's
no approved
racy matrix you know nobody knows who's
the sponsor who is the project manager
who is responsible accountable to be
consulted to be informed right this is
the racy matrix right
um
i mean you don't even have it let alone
get it approved right
so when you don't do it you know what
you get
right massive
massive pushback on every single step
you take yep every single step you take
um everybody pushes back
um and then you have to have a million
of alignment calls you know meetings and
pre-meeting alignment oh we have to
align before the meeting right let's
loop that person in this person in and
then he says this and he you know she
says that
oh if you're lost right you cannot
implement a project this way you'll get
lost
and
yeah
you know what was interesting
you know that pmi the project management
institute released its uh study
i read it recently but i don't know how
old it is
they said in that
study that 90 of the projects fail
i mean i personally know they do too and
it's mostly because of what i just
mentioned
okay now this effect
let me share with you another fact
uh
i was a management consultant right as
you know um with pwc consultant price
warrior scoopers for so many years and
and i've had over 200 projects
that i ran as project manager
for our clients
many different projects too like
different scope
and i'd say it's a it's a 100
success rate right well i'd say a
hundred percent but i just came from an
ayahuasca trip
from the jungle so i want to say it's a
90 success rate i'm trying to control my
ego
um
so now why is that the case right why is
there such a big variance between the
big four consultants and the regular
companies right even though even if they
are the biggest companies sometimes you
know the biggest multinationals you know
it could be google coca-cola you know
you name it unilever png but the big
four guys kpmg ey deloitte and
the best of them price for us groupers
they have something different
you know what it is it is all in the
basics guys you know it's really just in
the basics it's not the advanced project
management methodologies you know really
complex stuff absolutely not just the
fundamentals we apply a very strict
although a simple yeah simple to follow
methodology
in a framework right and we do not steer
off of that path at all right
methodology gives you the path do this
first and then do that right and then
start with the charter right they then
based on the complexity a few questions
uh do the detailed plans if you need to
you know get it signed do the process
groups if you want to like it's all
there it's just a map just follow it
right this is the biggest difference
it's all in the basics
most people
don't treat their work as projects and
they end up skipping like
absolutely all the necessary and
must-have steps right you start well
what people do is this you
they start creating a list a task list
right like a to-do list thinking you
know wow
you're doing a great job you know i'm
doing a great job i'm putting few things
together i'm you know booking the
meetings i'm looking at our like shared
calendar right you're not doing a good
job you're just a time bomb right um
just a matter of time before you go off
um because when you don't follow a
project management methodology right or
at least the framework you know the
simplest things right
like that of pmis
then
everybody all the stakeholders becomes
your enemy right you'll fight most of
your stakeholders peers clients managers
everyone everyone will want just a
little bit more a little sooner a little
better
it wasn't agreed so why would they not i
would want to right you would want to
huh
everyone will start pushing the
boundaries simply because the boundaries
are paper-thin
the details are in the charter
or um
if if the details are not in the charter
if it is not signed
don't do it but people are like oh wait
a minute dennis we agreed on a porsche
level quality right now turn to corolla
level things come on and you know i
never said that right is it in the mom
minutes on the meeting no it's not so
prove it right i just implied it i
didn't mean it
you know i thought we were aligned you
know we had all these uh pre-alignment
meetings and not such a sad situation
now if this is with this is between you
and your manager it will get very ugly
right i mean you're gonna have to give
up
um
and it will happen right and and you'll
have to cave in you'll give in everybody
does not just everybody does you'll say
okay you know
the moment you say okay
it's called scope creep
yeah
that means you as a project manager can
no longer defend your scope
yeah you have to now deliver the 911
they ask for now how are you going to do
that good luck with it where we're going
to find the resources
everything costs right
again this is what we call
scope creep
sometimes the
the um opposite also happens
and um
when you're a junior
or that you're so desperate that you
really really really need to hang on to
your job you know you're going through a
bad bad situation
and that it is a very very small project
what you do is now you deliver more than
what they asked for
which almost always comes at the cost of
more resources too right and if they
wanted a 911 they should have asked for
it and they should have paid for it they
didn't ask for it they didn't pay for it
you know that level of quality i mean so
deliver the total crawler they asked for
no more than that this is called gold
plating
and it's equally dangerous as scope
creep
you shouldn't do that
and um and you're also given a lot of
schedule pressures too hey you know what
that microsoft client there they're big
man come on you know i know
um you said you could finish it in you
know
four weeks but i want it done in two
weeks okay
i don't know what you know we said it
was a four week work not two weeks
and then your manager's gonna be like
yeah i don't think so you know
i know you can do it everybody knows you
can like look around like everybody's
talking about you you know you're
getting all the praises you're the best
go get them tiger
and then you're like okay you know
thanks for your trust i guess all right
um i'll do it
what options do we have at that moment
the battle was gone the battle was lost
at the beginning when you didn't have
the charter and when you didn't fight
for signatures right
eventually one of three things is gonna
happen and it always happens
um just a matter of time it's a triangle
um with equal values so either you
sacrifice some quality through a scope
creep or run out of budget or experience
schedule delays
right that's it i mean that's the
definition of a project failure you just
failed you just miserably failed right
um and and um and most often at that
stage the projects get shelved
the only exception is that if it is a
one-man job then maybe you can work 20
hours a day
to make up the difference but then
you want for the next project you won't
have the stamina anymore right you'll
burn out
and now you're going to want to quit
right why
why not
i mean let's think about this
why wouldn't you quit let's look at that
life yeah let's make an empathy
who would want to be
part of such a crazy organization one
where youth where you think
is important you think people put such
immense pressure on you where you
constantly fail who's going to want to
fail all the time right it destroys your
self-confidence
it does
i had a brief period when i was a
consultant
like a few of my projects
i don't want to say failed but it was
saved at the end and it really destroyed
my confidence right at the end of the
day it is all your doing though it was
my doing too you didn't follow proper
project management steps and as a result
you know
it failed people are paying you
thousands of dollars right could you not
pick up a book could i not pick up a
book to fill in like a little bit of
knowledge gap that i had i should have
right
can you not watch a video you know
for you like the very very basics right
all you need to know it's there right
by the way i have a great video on this
project management fundamentals it's on
youtube it's free you should watch i'll
leave the link um everything you need to
know about project management the
process groups the templates even i'll
give you the templates everything is
there
you should watch it now this was my
career early on right when i worked for
big4 pwc consulting that's what i did we
came in to fix the broken projects those
that are scrapped
those projects that failed
and we get hired to make it a success or
sometimes the client knew
what they are and you know they're not
capable of so they engaged us from the
beginning without first failing yeah
this is what the consultants at big4 do
you know ey kpmg deloitte and again my
personal favorite pwc consulting price
for scoopers
so
anyway
this is um yeah this is what i did
well this is actually what i did let me
let me tell you when we engage a new
client
start with the project charter first
then based on what you need and the
complexity of the project then develop
plans for all the little process groups
right and then create a work uh wbs work
breakdown structure right so you're
gonna it's sort of like a really
advanced and tree form uh resource
distribution
thing
thing
um nothing advanced right it's uh it
would take me less than one week to
draft them all
and then and like all the paperwork i
need just one week and then i will
here's the important thing i will not
move
a single step until the charter is
approved right they put a little
resistance to stakeholders oh you know i
want this one to be better that thing to
be better you know i want it done sooner
you know
all your consultants we're paying you
all this money you know i'm sure it's no
it's like no problem right
and that's in fact where i almost failed
because i gave him way too much and i
was like yeah we're consultants yeah we
could do better you know and then i i
just gave in way too much
that i realized that project is no
longer implementable right
so
that's thank god i had uh really good
directors at the time that helps me
now i never budge i mean now i'm no
longer a consultant but after that
experience i never barge because i know
when i budge one of the three things
will suffer you know budget scope or
schedule you know it's a triangle with
equal values as i said you know if you
stretch one the others get affected
something has to give and once it is
signed and sealed
um and when i say signed signed by by by
all the stakeholders right important
stakeholders starting with the sponsor
one by one
then only i start protecting my scope
because my scope is not gonna change
right and sometimes people um
keep this in mind don't wanna sign it
you know they may just email back
something like okay fine i read it yeah
they're gonna be very
vague what they're doing is they're
trying to create the umbrella of
deniability to be used later if
something happens that they don't like i
never approved this show me
don't fall for it i did you don't okay
print it out
go to their office get their signature
wait there for hours if that's what what
it takes
i mean i remember once i posted it with
dhl to be a vacation spot in the middle
of alp mountains right for my client
work you know i got it delivered only to
name and then i got the approval from
him on the phone when i told him that i
was recording the conversation
because i suffered a lot so i realized
how important it is
do not start until all the stakeholders
that are in the charter signed it and if
they don't apply peer pressure you know
it's not a game of good boy yeah you
know be a bad boy sometimes that's okay
you know hey i want to start but roger
is not signing it right i mean you're
paying us all this money guys you know
our daily race is crazy expensive i feel
sorry but there's nothing i can do right
then what happens when they know that
you don't give in then everybody starts
putting pressure on roger and roger is
like eventually falling off accepted god
damn it right
i'll accept these specifications
whatever
there's are real life stories i mean
like hundreds of times i've experienced
this
and when you do these things
you go with concrete steps you will
never see pushbacks yeah like throughout
the project implementation you know
it'll be silky and smooth because the
scope is clear right there's a clear
responsibility assignment matrix right
everybody knows who is doing what no
surprises that's the key to a smooth
project that's how you make friends all
your colleagues and can actually become
friends right
at that point you just have to deliver
what you promised not worse but also not
better yeah remember the scope creep and
the gold plating yeah just what you
promised and at that point you need to
be like a bulldozer right once that
thing is signed there's no stopping you
get out of my way yeah
just a quick parenthesis here by the way
project management is a is a cross-field
practice yeah meaning whether you're in
finance or in accounting or pr and sales
marketing software engineering it's
everywhere even doctors use project
management
so it's not just for engineering or
software involvement everybody runs
projects it's just that sometimes people
don't know it
all right so once it is drafted signed
and sealed by all the stakeholders
as i said i will not change a single
thing anything throughout the execution
the implementation right
that's uh this one when we are busy with
getting done getting stuff done
right if they want to change if an
incredible out of this world opportunity
just you know
uh came up or that we realized that we
made a mistake in planning and then only
i can make a change but again only
through an official change request and
that has to be documented
that cr the change recourse has to be
approved by the sponsor and the
stakeholders right and and to be honest
i usually become a pain in the butt i
make it very difficult to get it
approved so i discourage others from
trying to change my scope in the future
because that's what happens you know you
don't want to set an example
because people always try you know let's
wait for the next version let me finish
this
no signature no change
and a change requires more resources i
want more money schedule budget whatever
you know
see how simple things are all you have
to do is just follow the basics and
stand your ground when you need to and
most of it it'll be at the beginning
right
what makes a great project manager with
100 success rate
fine 90
isn't the knowledge in advanced project
management in all honesty i couldn't
even run a really advanced billion
dollar project anyway i would be buried
in it right i don't have the skills for
it um
huge like those guys you know the huge
oil and gas projects you know thousands
of pages of plans for every single
process group i can't do that aerospace
projects not for me
but luckily
and quite fortunately for me and for 90
of individuals maybe more and most of
you
you never have to deal with such complex
project management methodologies ever in
your career yeah
it will never happen for you
i mean i've had more than 200 projects
or complex ones complex enough but the
basics the fundamentals just solved
everything
and once again i want to emphasize on
this one um you also make a lot of
friends you know with people you work
with they're never in a shock so there's
very little conflict of interest they
know what is coming you know they always
know what is next you get the bad blood
out of the way at the beginning planning
and approval stages right or phases if
you say larger project so you just
become friends very quickly
by the way we are great if you share
this video on linkedin
and
you can do that now just pause the video
and if you do feel free to search me and
add me to your connections
i'll be happy to connect with you if you
want to connect with me no problem
now i want to talk about what will now
happen to you
when you take the right steps when you
learn the just fundamentals of project
management
when you learn
and apply even just the basics
the fundamentals of project management
your endeavors at work your projects
all become a success right most of them
soon enough important stakeholders you
know your managers managers managers
managers right they realize your
achievements and when they do they test
you
they will give you a very very hard
project it's a good thing yeah don't
complain about it it's a good thing they
trust you yeah your manager wants to see
your managers want to see what you're
really capable of right how fast you can
go you can go how high you can climb
right if you're a ferrari what what good
is it for you to go at 60 kilometers an
hour right and imagine you pass that
test what happens that's when you start
enjoying all the good things that a
corporate career has to offer
much much higher salaries 10x the job
security multiple promotions right
and you know what above all above all
the materialistic things you'll feel
like a superstar right because
internally you will know
you're a winner man
yeah i mean that's an amazing feeling or
woman sorry
then imagine being treated at work like
the superstar you are it's an amazing
feeling i know about i mean i felt that
you know it was great
and to get all of these benefits what do
you need to do a harvard mba no
no it doesn't even cost much money maybe
none
yeah just the super basics fundamentals
of project management this is what
people call a low hanging fruit
yeah okay now i want to talk about
another low hanging fruit um
now you learned a valuable lesson so far
and hopefully one that will just
will give you a different branch in your
future right
and now i'd like you to listen to me for
two minutes on lig okay fair enough
because even if it is not for you it may
be for someone you care about at least
find out what it is
now if you want to have a better job a
better career yeah perhaps
i want you to come and join my lig
program it is mine i'm not promoting
anyone else yeah over 7 000 people
joined uh since 2017 and we have
achieved over 80 success rate that is a
remarkable success rate 80
right
what does that mean it means 80 of the
joiners
thousands of people doubled or even
tripled their salary and upgraded their
living standards all because of the
strategies i thought
in the program right because really if
you think
the best way to find a job is online
advertisements and job boards trust me
it is the worst it is like just stay
away from them you know they'll only
ruin your self-confidence i want to
teach you just step by step what to do
right hold your hand and and and show
you right because what you're learning
in lig is the only way in my opinion to
find a quality job a quality career
anywhere around the world right even if
you want to move to another country and
lig is a charitable activity for us
right we don't use any of the profits
that's why i'm so passionate about it my
real job my real passion in life at
least after i concluded my management
consulting career is
it's funny but it's a base metals and
also you know
nickel silver and precious metals too
and gold and
i don't want to get into details but i
also consult the governments and all and
what matters is all the profits from lig
goes to support young nigerian girls
it's a cause that hits me so so deeply
when i visited lagos for a client
project almost 10 years ago
and since then i supported a lot of
young girls with their education and and
life expenses
and most of them you will actually see
them commenting below
my videos they're they're almost in
their early early 20s now it's been a
while
now we have a new class of students
coming up so that's why i decided to
shoot this video
uh
talk about lig after almost i think a
three month absence
guys this is when capitalism works
uh works the best if you need help i
help you you pay me i pay them
right and twitter
you and i we save them from the worst
kind of predators that i think
human predators right they're everywhere
and they they look for the weak
this way everybody wins and and if you
don't get a better job you know what no
problem i'll refund you yeah i want you
to succeed no risk for you at all right
and the program also comes with a direct
access to me for all your career
questions for a lifetime for my lifetime
at least right
and um
all right so thank you for listening and
i hope to see you in lig otherwise i
will see you here probably in a month or
two of worst case three
thank you
